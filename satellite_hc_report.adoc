= Satellite Health Check Report

This is a health check report for the {{ ansible_hostname }} Satellite server conducted on a {{ ansible_distribution }} {{ansible_distribution_version }} instance, at {{ ansible_date_time.time }} on {{ ansible_date_time.date }}.

== Analysis

=== Health Check Overview:
{{ result_health_check.stdout }}

=== Satellite Service Status:
{{ result_running_services.stdout | to_nice_yaml }}


== Satellite Configuration

=== Satellite System Details

*Investigation:* What version of RHEL is the Satellite server running on? What is the architecture? Is the CPU suitable to the Satellite server? is the hostname unique?

*Observation:*

- Hostname: {{ result_hostname.stdout | to_nice_yaml }}

- IP Address: {{ result_ip_addr.stdout | to_nice_yaml }}

- Kernel Version: {{ result_kernel_version.stdout | to_nice_yaml }}

- Uptime: {{ result_uptime.stdout | to_nice_yaml }}

- Last Reboot Time: {{ result_reboot.stdout | to_nice_yaml }}

- Red Hat Release: {{ result_redhat_release.stdout | to_nice_yaml }}

The CPU usage information is as follows:

{{ result_system_cpu.stdout_lines | to_nice_yaml}}

Is there at least 20gb of disk space available in /var?

{{ result_disk_space.stdout_lines | to_nice_yaml }}

*Guidance:* #TODO#

*Rationale:* There should be at least 20 gig of space available in /var directory to perform future synchronizations. Please note that if you are to download a major release (e.g. RHEL 6 Server), you will require a minimum of 20Gig per release.


=== Satellite and Capsule Architecture
|=======
|*Investigation:*| List the names and urls of the Satellite and Capsule servers. List the organisations linked to the Satellite and Capsule servers.
|*Guidance:*| #TODO#
|*Rationale:*| #TODO#
|=======
*Observation:*

{{ result_capsule_list.stdout }}

{{ result_organization_list.stdout }} 

NOTE: For more information on a given organisation, run `hammer organization info --id <id_number>`

=== Satellite Version 
|======
|*Investigation:*| What is the currently installed Satellite version on the Satellite server and the capsules? What was the initial installation version?
|*Guidance:*| #TODO#
|*Rationale:*| #TODO#
|======

*Observation:* 

{{ result_satellite_version.stdout_lines | to_nice_yaml }} is installed on the Satellite server.
{% if result_capsule_version.failed == false %}

{{ result_capsule_version.stdout_lines | to_nice_yaml }} is installed on the Capsule server.
{% else %}
Package satellite-capsule is not installed on the Capsule Server.
{% endif %}

=== Firewalls and Proxy
|=====
|*Investigation:| Is firewalling appropriately configured for the Satellite and Capsule servers? Is the proxy server able to access cdn.redhat.com and subscription.rhsm.redhat.com directly without SSL termination? Are the required ports open? Are any optional ports opened?
|Guidance:| #TODO#
|Rationale:
a|
Generally, the following 12 ports should be open on the firewall:

- 80/tcp
- 443/tcp
- 5647/tcp
- 8000/tcp
- 8140/tcp 
- 8443/tcp
- 9090/tcp
- 53/tcp
- 53/udp
- 67/udp
- 69/udp
- 5000/tcp
|=====
*Observation:* 
The ports that are currently open are - 
{{ result_firewall_ports.stdout | to_nice_yaml }}


== Infrastructure

=== Infrastructure Architecture
|=====
|*Investigation:*| List the organisations and locations associated with the Satellite server.
|*Guidance:*| #TODO#
|*Rationale:*| #TODO#
|=====
*Observation:*

{{ result_hammer_org.stdout }}

{{ result_hammer_location.stdout }}


=== Network Requirements
|=====
|*Investigation:*| The network connectivey between Satellite and its capsules needs to be reliable. Can the Satellite connect to the CDN without issue? Do the FQDN, Domain, and Shortname connections resolve?
|*Guidance:*| #TODO#
|*Rationale:*| #TODO#
|=====
*Observation:*

----
{{ result_ping.stdout_lines | to_nice_yaml }}

== Storage

=== Qpidd Storage
|=====
|*Investigation:*| Is the qpidd service available? How much space is available in the qpidd partition? is the qpidd parititon too large?
|*Guidance:*| #TODO#
|*Rationale:*| #TODO#
|=====
*Observation:*

{% if result_qpidd_status.failed == false %}
{{ result_qpidd_status.stdout | to_nice_yaml }}
{% else %}
{{ result_qpidd_status.stderr_lines | to_nice_yaml }}
{% endif %}

{% if result_qpidd_status.failed == false %}
{{ result_qpidd_storage.stdout | to_nice_yaml }}
{% else %}
{{ result_qpidd_storage.stderr_lines | to_nice_yaml }}
{% endif %}

=== Backup/Restore Procedures
|=====
|*Investigation:*| If the client is using snapshots, what are the backups listed in foreman-maintain backups? What kinds of backup procedures are in place for the Satellite? The consultant will likely have to ask the client for additional information on procedures and backup philosophy.
|*Observation:*| #CONSULTANT TODO#
|*Guidance:*| #CONSULTANT TODO#

== Host Management

=== Remote Execution
|=====
|*Investigation:*| Is remote execution set up on Satellite? Is cron used to execute these remote jobs?

|=====

=== Errata
|=====
|*Investigation:*| Are errata used? How is Errata managed? What errata are installable on the registered hosts?
|*Guidance:*| #TODO#
|*Rationale:*| As a part of Red Hatâ€™s quality control and release process, we provide customers with updates for each release of official Red Hat RPMs. Red Hat compiles groups of related package into an erratum along with an advisory that provides a description of the update. Security Advisory errata describe fixed security issues found in the package. Bug Fix Advisory errata describes bug fixes, and Product Enhancement Advisory describes enhancements and new features added to the package. 
|=====
*Observation:*

#NOTE# - The errata variable has been omitted in the report due to size of role. Replace the variable here if you choose to include the role.

== Satellite Management

=== Satellite Logging
|=====
|*Investigation:*| Are any errors logged in the foreman, foreman-proxy, or /var logs? Do any issues tie in with other issues identified in the report?
|*Guidance:*| #TODO#
|*Rationale:*| Any errors that appear in the logs should be investigated to ensure that Satellite is functioning effectively and correctly to avoid bugs and security vulnerabilities. 
|=====
*Observation:*

+ /var/log/foreman/production.log returns:

{% if result_production_log.failed == false %}
{{ result_production_log.stdout_lines | to_nice_yaml }}
{% else %}
The production.log does not contain any errors.
{% endif %}

+ /var/log/foreman-proxy/proxy.log returns:

{% if result_proxy_log.failed == false %}
{{ result_proxy_log.stdout_lines | to_nice_yaml }}
{% else %}
The proxy.log does not contain any errors.
{% endif %}

+ /var/log/messages returns:

{% if result_messages_log.failed == false %}
{{ result_messages_log.stdout_lines | to_nice_yaml }}
{% else %}
The messages log does not contain any errors.
