Satellite Configuration

Satellite System Requirements
Investigation: What version of RHEL is the Satellite server running on? What is the architecture? Is the CPU suitable to the Satellite server? is the hostname unique?
Observation:
Host and RHEL version details:
{{ result_system_reqs.stdout_lines | to_nice_yaml }}
The CPU usage information is as follows:
