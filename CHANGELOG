# Changed
- updated inventory for satellite and capsule groups + playbook hosts to reference inventory groups

- removed quotes around {{ ansible_hostname }} so the output filename is not quoted
	eg satellite_hc_report_sat-1.adoc instead of  'satellite_hc_report_"sat-1".adoc'

- updated roles/firewall_and_proxy_check to streamline the shell cmd

- Refactored adoc template to use ansible.builtin vars rather than registered output from shell commands.
  - Renamed roles/system_reqs_check to roles/disk_space_check because all other tasks were redundant

- Updated satellite_hc_init.yml to include disk_space_check role as mentioned above
